Link to deployed site:
This weeks challenge was to create a weather forecast site using a third party server api
When a city is entered into the search form
Then the user is given a current forecast and a five day forecast

Skills Implemented: HTML, CSS, Jvascript

To the best of my ability I utilized an api key and set up a fetch request to find the locations latitude and longitude in order to request the city I was searching for. Afterwards I continued to use the .then() clocks to further my code to set up local storage and then to fetch current and a five day forecast result.

Lessons learned:
