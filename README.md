This weeks challenge was to create a weather forecast site using a third party server api
When a city is entered into the search form
Then the user is given a current forecast and a five day forecast

Skills Implemented: HTML, CSS, Jvascript

To the best of my ability I utilized an api key and set up a fetch request to find the locations latitude and longitude in order to request the city I was searching for. Afterwards I continued to use the .then() clocks to further my code to set up local storage and then to fetch current and a five day forecast result.

Lessons learned:

So some lessons that I learned during this project was how to properly utilize a fetch request to get access to the weather data. Struggled a bit at first but with a little help from a tutor I started to understand a bit more. I realized that I could use the .then() blocks to further my code without having to create outside functions which was really helpful and was able to get the majority of my code done within one function. Also I had a few moments of just being very proud of myself cause I was able to troubleshoot some issues I was having with my code and fixed the issues. still struggling with css but slowly but surely I'll get it.
